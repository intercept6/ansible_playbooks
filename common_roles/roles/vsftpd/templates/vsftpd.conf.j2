# mangling on files when in ASCII mode.

# attack (DoS) via the command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd
# predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the
# raw file.
# ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.

# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by
